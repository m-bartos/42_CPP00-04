# 42_CPP00-04
Basics of C++ at 42 Prague.

## CPP_00
Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff.

* ex00 - Megaphone
  - The goal is to output the second argument of the program. If no argument is present, print default message.
  - argc, argv, std::cout, std::endl

* ex01 - My awesome phonebook
  - he goal is to implement Phonebook program with adding and searching functionalities.
  - *.hpp, classes, methods, public/private variables and methods

* ex02 - The Job Of Your Dreams
  - The goal is to rewrite the .cpp file (make class, variables, methods etc.) from .hpp file, main.cpp and output log of main function.
  - *.hpp, classes, methods, public/private variables and methods
 
## CPP_01
Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement.

* ex00 - BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ
  - The goal is to determine in what case itâ€™s better to allocate the zombies on the stack or heap and how to destroy them correctly.
  - stack/heap object allocation (new, delete), *.hpp, classes, methods, public/private variables and methods
  
* ex01 - Moar brainz!
  - The goal is to allocate N Zombie objects in a single allocation. Then, it has to initialize the zombies, giving each one of them the name passed as parameter. The function returns a pointer to the first zombie.
  - stack/heap object allocation (new, delete), array of objects, *.hpp, classes, methods, public/private variables and methods
 
* ex02 - HI THIS IS BRAIN
  -  The goal of this exercise is to demystify references which can seem completely new. Although there are some little differences, this is another syntax for something you already do: address manipulation.
  - pointers, references in C++
 
* ex03 - Unnecessary violence
  - The goal of this exercise is to be able assign the object of one class to the object of another class.
  - pointers, references in C++

* ex04 - Sed is for losers
  - Create a program that takes three parameters in the following order: a filename and two strings, s1 and s2. It will open the file <filename> and copies its content into a new file <filename>.replace, replacing every occurrence of s1 with s2.
  - file and string manipulation (open, is_open, close, insert, erase, etc.), getline(), argc, argv, std::err

* ex05 - Harl 2.0
  - The goal of this exercise is to use pointers to member functions.
  - [pointers to member function](https://public.websites.umich.edu/~eecs381/handouts/Pointers_to_memberfuncs.pdf)
 
 * ex06 - Harl filter
  - The goal of this exercise is to use pointers to member functions and switch statement.
  - pointer to member function, switch
